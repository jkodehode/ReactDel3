      <h1>THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>
        Cardano is a PoS / Proof of Stake blockchain that supports both
        transactions and smart contracts. Transactions on the chain is done with
        its native cryptocoin ADA. ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, the british
        "grevinne" which are assumed as the worlds first comupter programmer
      </p>
      <h3>What</h3>
      <p>
        Cardano can be used as payment for anything. It can also be used to make
        smart contracts and decentrelised appa like defi games, apps and much
        more
      </p>
      <h3>Open Source</h3>
      <p>
        Cardano is an open protocoll. Anyone can participate in securing the
        network, do transactions or build decentrelised apps that is stored in
        the Cardano Blockchain
      </p>

      <h2>Hisotry of Cardano</h2>
      <p>
        Charles Hoskinson. US born mathmatichan, programmer and entrepenour.
        Started as one of the founders of Ethereum, but seperated theyr way when
        Charles wanted to build in a more commercial matter. In the end of 1016
        he launched Cardano trough a sucsesfull ICO wich collected 62 Mill USD.
        Started of as an improved version of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and has
        trough the years been updated and improved upon
      </p>
      <h2>Partners</h2>
      <p>
        The Cardano-system has three partners that is escpesially important for
        maintance and development of the chain and enviorment around Cardano
      </p>
      <h3>Cardano Foundation</h3>
      <p>
        An independent standard-organization based in Zug, Switzerland. It's
        main task is to oversee the development of Cardano and the eco-system
        around it. Cardano Foundation stimulates incorperation and usage of the
        Cardano blockchain. Stimulating both cooperation and partnership, but
        also growth in the Cardano enviorment and helping goverments abroad
        shape laws and commercial standards. Cardano Foundation is also the
        owner of the Cardano-brand
      </p>
      <h2>What it is</h2>
      <h2>Language</h2>
      <h3>Haskell</h3>
      <p>
        This is used for the smart contracts on the Cardano Blockchain. Haskell
        is what you call a "clean" programing language and is based on matematic
        princips and functions. This makes it easier to verify the functinality,
        so its more unlikely to do mistakes or find weaknesses in smart
        contracts and decentrelised apps(dApps). Even if Cardano is focusing on
        Haskell as their primary language, they have introduced K Ethereum
        Vitrual Machine(KEVM). This is a framework making it possible for
        solidity developers to use customized smart contracts and dApps written
        in solidity on the Cardano Blockchain
      </p>
      <h4>Front-End connenction</h4>
      <p>
        To connect a smart contract to the front end languages as React and
        Javascript can be used
      </p>
      <p>Cardano to React</p>
